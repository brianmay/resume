Debian packaging
:   Technologies: variety

    Packaging packages for inclusion in Debian.

    Debian is a free non-proprietary operating system, which is designed
    and implemented by volunteers world wide. I maintain a number of
    packages for Debian and I am part of the Debian Python Modules Team. I
    contribute to mailing list discussions on the future directions that the
    operations should take.

    Good communication is absolutely vital. All communications must be done
    via electronic means over different time zones. If there is a misunderstanding,
    it is not possible to meet face to face to resolve the problem.
    As such, I have obtained skills required for communicating to other Debian
    developers in an effective manner, using tools like Email and the Debian bug
    tracking system.
