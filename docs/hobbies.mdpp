## Hobbies

### Open Source Software

I am the upstream maintainer for open source software, including Spud,
and sshuttle. [Spud](https://github.com/brianmay/spud/) is an open
source database for Photos written in Python/Django.
[sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle/). is a VPN wrapper for SSH.

My most recent project is [Robotica](https://github.com/brianmay/robotica/),
a scheduling system to try to help with routine tasks around the house, especially
routine tasks associated with 3 autistic kids.

### Open Source Hardware

I have designed open source software and 3d model for
[remote control](https://github.com/brianmay/robotica-remote/) for
Robotica.

### Photography

I have taken many photos using both digital and film based cameras.
Some of these photos are on my web site.

### Flying

I have obtained my PPL (private pilots license) that allows me to fly anywhere
in Australia. I have flown several different types of aircraft, including the
Piper Warrior, Piper Archer, Tobago and the Victor Air Tourer.

### Music

Playing the violin, oboe and recorder.
