Organisations
=============

MelbournePUG

Linux Australia and LUV
-----------------------
I regularly attend linux.conf.au conferences and Linux Users Victoria meetings.

regularly attend Free Software Melbourne meetings.

PTUA
----
Public Transport Users Association: a lobby group with the aim to improve and
promote the use of public transport as an alternative to being dependent on the
car.

Tesla
-----
I own a Tesla Model S, and believe that the extra cost is worth it in terms of
minimizing damage to the environment. While I believe the future is in improving public
transport, the fact is that public transport is not currently sufficient for all of
my transport needs, and driving an electric car is much better then driving a fossil fuel
based car.
