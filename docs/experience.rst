WSP Digital
-----------
| Senior Software Engineer,
| May 2016 to present

At WSP Digital I am a Python/Django/JavaScript software developer. This
company does consulting work for a number of big clients. In working for
this company I gained considerable knowledge in AWS services, such as EC2
and ECS. I also worked in different teams with different
protocols for working together and diverse range of opinions.

The University of Melbourne
---------------------------
| Python Developer,
| April 2016 to present

The University of Melbourne uses a project called Karaage for management of users
on their super computer clusters. This Works with Python, Django, LDAP. They
require me to maintain Karaage, because I was the lead developer of Karaage while
at VPAC. This is a difficult project to maintain, because there are numerous users
of Karaage we have lost contact with since the demise of VPAC. As such there is a
lot of complexity in legacy code and difficult decisions need to be made when the
legacy code can be removed or refactored. I have also started a blog to attempt to
`document <https://karaage-cluster.github.io/>`_ some of the key changes.

Debian
------
| Package Developer,
| January 1998 to present

Debian is a free non-proprietary operating system, which is designed
and implemented by volunteers world wide. I started by packaging
maintaining the Heimdal package for Debian (Kerberos). Currently I
maintain a number of Python packages as part of the Debian Python
Modules Team. I contribute to mailing list discussions on the future
directions that the operating should take.

Debian is a global project with developers from all over
the world. Good coordination and communication skills are essential
in making this work efficiently. As such, I have obtained skills
required for communicating to other Debian developers in an effective
manner, using tools like Email and the Debian bug tracking system.

Good communications is absolutely vital. All communications must be done
via electronic means over different time zones. If there is a misunderstanding,
it is not possible to meet face to face to resolve the problem.

Freexian (Debian LTS)
---------------------
| Package Developer,
| February 2016 to present

Freexian sponsors creating security updated packages for legacy Debian based
operating systems. This is a thankless task that must be done very carefully
so as not to break critical computer systems. It involves
coordination with other team members, the Debian security team, the
package maintainers, upstream authors, and any other relevant party.

Microcom Australia
------------------
| Systems Administrator,
| December 1993 to December 2017

I have setup a secure network infrastructure, with backed up data.
Traditionally such a setup would have required multiple computers,
leading to higher setup costs and higher running costs. I am
constantly on the look out for new programs to help ease
administration and make the system more secure. Initially I used XEN
to host my virtual systems; currently I am using Proxmox using
OpenVZ and KVM sessions.

VPAC (aka V3 Alliance)
----------------------
| Systems Administrator / Python Developer,
| May 2006 to June 2015

Initially I was responsible for the administration of the desktop
computers. This includes the initial installation of the operating
system (CentOS), and installing new software. I installed and
administrated the tape backup system (Tivoli Storage Manager). I
also assist with administrating the network. This has involved
considerable work with both Linux and Windows.

Later on, I moved to more Python 2 and Python 3 programming, especially
with the open source Karaage project. Karaage is a Python/Django based
website for management of users on supercomputer clusters. At one stage
there were installations at different sites across the entire country.
This required the ability to understand the different and sometimes conflicting
requirements and the flexibility to attempt to implement these requirements.

Other
-----
Previously I have worked for a number of other companies. Most notable:

- 4 years working as a Systems administrator for SWS.
- 3 years working as a PHP Developer at IVT.
