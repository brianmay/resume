Software Development
--------------------
I keep my skills up to date by a combination of professional work, personal
projects, and open source projects I contribute to. I also attend the PyCon AU
conference annually.

Designing computer programs and websites that automate tasks that otherwise
would have to be done manually. Use of modern revision control systems
including SVN, BZR, Monotone, Mercurial, and especially Git. My recent
experience is in Django and Django Rest Framework, with Python 2/Python 3 for
Linux based systems. On the front end, I am also experienced with JavaScript
(including ES6), TypeScript, and frameworks such as Angular2 and Vue.

I am also experienced with testing with Travis and Continuous Integration (CI)
using Gerrit and Jenkins. My current project involves Continuous Deployment (CD)
of docker based images using a 3rd party service called shippable on Amazon ECS.
I have learned about using Zuul with Gerrit and Jenkins.

I have open source repositories on GitHub. Including SPUD - a photo database
using Django Rest Framework and Angular2 technologies, Karaage - a management
system for Super Computer clusters, and TLDAP - an Object Relation Mapping
(ORM) Python library to talk to LDAP servers with different schemas.

I have also given talks at Conferences such as PyCon AU and local user
group meetings on my software.

Languages: Python 2, Python 3, C, C++, Ada, Perl, Java, JavaScript,
Typescript, and Bash.

Linux/Unix Computer Administration
----------------------------------
I keep my Linux skills up to date by maintaining computer and network
systems for personal use. I also attend the Linux.conf.au conference on
an annual basis.

Networking. Computer networking with Ethernet, TCP/IP (including TCP/IP
applications), IPv6, SLIP, PPP, IPPP, and SMB protocols. I have setup a
system where you can boot up Linux on a computer without the need for
any local disk drives, as everything required is accessed through the
network. I can also deal with CISCO switches and CISCO routers. I
administrate my own Internet server that hosts websites, a mail server,
and telephone exchange.

Virtual machine hosts, including those based on Ganeti, OpenVZ, KVM,
LXC, Xen, oVirt. Have also explored OpenStack and VMWare.

TSM tape backups, IBM tape libraries, LTO4 tape drives. Bacula backup
software.

.. index:: security, SSL, GnuPG, SE-Linux

Computer Security
-----------------
Authentication and Authorisation. Use and understanding of public key
technologies, such as SSL and GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard).

Concept of least privileges. Understanding of how SE-Linux (Security Enhanced
Linux) works, and its potential for increasing security on Linux computers.
Using Xen, KVM, OpenVZ to isolate different programs to allow greater degree of
control over the resources (including network resources) they can access.
