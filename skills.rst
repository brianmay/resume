Software Development
--------------------
I keep my Python skills up to date by annually attending the PyCon AU
conference. I also am responsible for maintaining a number of Python
packages â€“ in Debian and as upstream.

Designing computer programs that automate tasks that otherwise would
have to be done manually. Use of modern revision control systems
including svn, git, bzr, monotone, and mercurial. My recent experience
is in Django, with Python 2/Python 3 for Linux based systems. I am also
experienced with testing with Travis and Continuous integration (CI)
using Gerrit and Jenkins. I have learned about using Zuul with Gerrit
and Jenkins. Since leaving my previous job, I have continued to develop
these skills, and have learnt about packages such as
Django-Rest-Framework.

Languages: Python 2, Python 3, C, C++, Ada, Perl, Java, JavaScript,
Typescript, and Bash.

Linux/Unix Computer Administration
----------------------------------
I keep my Linux skills up to date by maintaining computer and network
systems for personal use. I also attend the Linux.conf.au conference on
an annual basis.

Networking. Computer networking with Ethernet, TCP/IP (including TCP/IP
applications), IPv6, SLIP, PPP, IPPP, and SMB protocols. I have setup a
system where you can boot up Linux on a computer without the need for
any local disk drives, as everything required is accessed through the
network. I can also deal with CISCO switches and CISCO routers. I
administrate my own Internet server that hosts websites, a mail server,
and telephone exchange.

Virtual machine hosts, including those based on Ganeti, OpenVZ, KVM,
LXC, Xen, oVirt. Have also explored OpenStack and VMWare.

TSM tape backups, IBM tape libraries, LTO4 tape drives. Bacula backup
software.

.. index:: security, SSL, GnuPG, SE-Linux

Computer Security
-----------------
Authentication and Authorisation. Use and understanding of public key
technologies, such as SSL and GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard).

Concept of least privileges. Understanding of how SE-Linux (Security Enhanced
Linux) works, and its potential for increasing security on Linux computers.
Using Xen, KVM, OpenVZ to isolate different programs to allow greater degree of
control over the resources (including network resources) they can access.

.. index:: cloud, Dropbox, SpiderOak, unison, tahoe-lafs, SparkleShare

Cloud storage solutions
-----------------------
Understanding of cloud based backup solutions, including benefits and
limitations, including Dropbox, SpiderOak, unison, tahoe-lafs, SparkleShare,
git annex, and others.
