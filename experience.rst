Freexian (Debian LTS)
---------------------
| Package Developer,
| February 2016 to present

Creating security updated packages for legacy Debian based operating
systems. This is a thankless task that must be done very carefully
so as not to break critical computer systems. It involves
coordination with other team members, the Debian security team, the
package maintainers, upstream authors, and any other relevant party.

VPAC (aka V3 Alliance)
----------------------
| Systems Administrator / Python Developer,
| May 2006 to June 2015

Initially I was responsible for the administration of the desktop
computers. This includes the initial installation of the operating
system (CentOS), and installing new software. I installed and
administrated the tape backup system (Tivoli Storage Manager). I
also assist with administrating the network. This has involved
considerable work with both Linux and Windows. Later on, I moved to
more Python2 and Python3 programming, especially with the open
source Karaage project.

Major projects include:

-  Implementing and maintaing a Windows Domain. Research Samba 4.
-  Unattended installation of OS on computers using Unattended, Wpkg,
   and Puppet.
-  Inventory of computers and software installed on computers to ensure
   compliance with software licenses. Lintory is a Python/Django
   application.
-  Maintain backup server running Tivoli and backup tape library.
-  Upgrade old TS3500 tape library to latest firmware, node cards, and
   LTO5 drives.
-  Debug/assist with various systems/network/filesystem issues.
-  Administrating network, routers, CISCO switches, Linux firewalls,
   VLANs, IPv6, etc.
-  Maintain and develop Karaage. A open source Python2 and Python3, that
   talks to databases such as MySQL, Postgresql, OpenLDAP, ds389, AD,
   MAM, and Slurm. Development used continuous integration (CI) using
   Gerrit and Jenkins.
-  Providing Karaage support to VLSCI and other clients as required.
-  Maintain server with Debian/Redhat packages and Gerrit/Jenkins for
   Karaage CI.
-  Creating and maintaining packages required for Karaage in Debian.
   Fixing broken tests and otherwise assisting upstream developers as
   required.
-  Karaage talk at PyCon AU 2015.
-  Placard. Another open source Python2 Python3 program for
   reading/writing users in LDAP, which supports a number of schemas
   (e.g. Openldap and AD).

Major Achievements:

-  Good Teamwork and communication skills with users, developers and
   administrators.
-  Success in debugging numerous technical issues with computers and
   networking infrastructure.
-  Successfully made large scale restores from TSM tape backup on
   several occasions.

| Systems Administrator,
| December 1993 to present

I have set up a secure network infrastructure, with backed up data.
Traditionally such a setup would have required multiple computers,
leading to higher setup costs and higher running costs. I am
constantly on the look out for new programs to help ease
administration and make the system more secure. Initially I used XEN
to host my virtual systems; currently I am using Proxmox using
OpenVZ and KVM sessions.

Major projects include:

-  Internet connection to Internode, with full support for IPv6.
-  Public SMTP server with anti-spam configuration.
-  Public web servers for several websites based on Apache, Drupal,
   Ikiwiki, and Spud.
-  Asterisk PBX system.
-  Upgrading Asterisk to Freeswitch.
-  MythTV system for digital recording and playback of TV shows.
-  Infrastructure requirements for the above, including DNS servers,
   CISCO router, Firewalls, VLANs, IPv6, Virtual Xen hosts.

Major Achievements:

-  Detailed understanding of Linux and IP networking.

Debian
------
| Package Developer,
| January 1998 to present

Debian is a free non-proprietary operating system, which is designed
and implemented by volunteers world wide. I started by packaging
maintaining the Heimdal package for Debian (Kerberos). Currently I
maintain a number of Python packages as part of the Debian Python
Modules Team. I contribute to mailing list discussions on the future
directions that the operating should take.

Major Achievements:

-  Increased my knowledge extensively during the course of contributing
   to Debian, including, but not limited to learning standards such as
   autoconf, automake, libtool, and XML.

-  Teamwork. Debian is a global project with developers from all over
   the world. Good coordination and communication skills are essential
   in making this work efficiently. As such, I have obtained skills
   required for communicating to other Debian developers in an effective
   manner, using tools like E-Mail and the Debian bug tracking system.
-  I maintain and help maintain a number of packages in Debian. The
   exact list can vary without notice, however as of writing includes
   Heimdal, Django, Django Rest Framework, and a number of other Python
   packages.
